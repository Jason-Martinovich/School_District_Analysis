# School_District_Analysis
## Purpose of the Analysis
For this challenge, the assignment was to help Maria a school boardmember run an anlysis on testing data across the school district. With the information provided, we will  analysize the data on student funding and test scores.  The analysis will provide insights on performance patterns and trends at each school. These insights will be used to make decisions for the school district budget and priorities.  After the initial analysis was completed, Maria requested that we update and remove student test scores because cheating was suspected.  With these changes, a new anaylsis was done.

## Results
After analyzing the results with the updated changes, the overall numbers did not change much.  Infact, the difference was a small drop in fractions of a percent for Thomas High School.  For the Challenge we had to remove 461 students from the enitre district that consists of 39,170 students.  The ninth grade at Thomas highschool will see a signifact impact if that was the only measurment.  However since we are measuring and comparing the entire student population in the district, a small change in numbers to the student population did not impact the overall perfromance measures.  Since everything else remained the same for 14 other schools, no changes were seen to their individual performacne numbers.
