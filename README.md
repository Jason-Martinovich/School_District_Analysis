# School_District_Analysis
## Purpose of the Analysis
For this challenge, the assignment was to help Maria a school boardmember run an anlysis on testing data across the school district. With the information provided, we will  analysize the data on student funding and test scores.  The analysis will provide insites on performance patterns and trends at each school. These insights will be used to make decisions for the school district budget and priorities.  After the initial analysis was completed, Maria requested that we update and remove student test scores because cheating was suspected.  With these changes, a new anaylsis was done.
